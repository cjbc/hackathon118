## Project Info
OpenRoaming works similarly to Eduroam, allowing users to automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks, but with a federated structure that allows multiple Access Network Providers (ANPs) and multiple Identity Providers (IDPs) to interoperate under the same federation. It leverages technologies developed in the IETF, IEEE802 and Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA), such as RADIUS/RADSEC/PKI (RFCs 2865, 3579, 4372, 5280, 6614…), IEEE 802.1X, 802.11, and WFA WPA2/WPA3. 

OpenRoaming is being discussed as a solution to some of the use cases considered by the IETF MADINAS WG. **The project will look for potential areas of improvement to IETF protocols, as well as potential leakage of PIIs.**

NOTE1: Hackathon participants wanting to be issued a test certificate for use in mutually authenticated OpenRoaming signalling exchanges, should email <pki@wballiance.com> with the subject “IETF Hackathon Test Certificate Request”.

NOTE2: The OpenRoaming PKI Certificate Policy and WBA issuing I-CA require specific subject distinguished name values. An example certificate signing request configuration that meets the OpenRoaming Certificate Policy is available [here](https://github.com/wireless-broadband-alliance/openroaming-config/blob/main/OpenRoaming CSR config.cfg)
